# AKGLKit
AKGLKit is a public repository is created for some replacement for Apple's GLKit Framework classes or some Open GL ES methods or you can use them and make your own changes.

With this repository every code is commented out defining what it does so you wont get confused
We will be adding supports for more classes as we go by.

You can replace some GLKit classes with classes in this repository to make your own changes as you go on.

Right now we just have only code for how GLKView known as AKGLKView and GLKViewController known as AKGLKViewController works and a wrapper for OpenGL ES vertex buffer array.

We will be adding Cocoapods support soon so stay tuned ðŸ˜Ž
