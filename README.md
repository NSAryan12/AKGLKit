# AKGLKit
AKGLKit is a public repository to help people learn how the ï£¿ GLKit framework works.
With this repository every code is commented out defining what it does so you wont get confused
We will be adding supports for more classes as we go by and hopefully we will have all the classes of GLKit their.
